# Assignment

In case of `classInharitance` & `encapsulation` Download those directory in your computer's xampp or wampp's `htdocs` folder, start the apache server; now open your browser & nevigate to those directory separately.

& In case of `toDoApp` just download the `rar` file and extract in your desired directory. Now, open 2 terminal (command prompt / power shell) tabs or window & run each commands separately & visit from your browser to this URL `http://localhost:8000`.

```shell
php artisan serve
```
```shell
yarn dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> No need for any kind of database setup in `toDoApp`, as a database I've used sqlite. That `rar` file should contain an `sqlite.database` file. After running those servers, everything should work properly.
